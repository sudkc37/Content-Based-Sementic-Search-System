This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on their genres, titles, and descriptions. Using CountVectorizer, the system transforms movie metadata into feature vectors, representing each movie as a "bag-of-words." Cosine similarity is then applied to measure the similarity between movies, enabling the system to identify and recommend films with closely related content. 

The model has been saved as a pickle file, which allows for quick and efficient loading without needing to recompute the similarity matrix each time. This repository provides a simple yet powerful recommendation engine, ideal for exploring content-based filtering using NLP and cosine similarity techniques.

For the UI, when the user opens the app, the system initially provides random suggestions. As soon as the user searches for specific content, the system updates to recommend relevant items based on their interests.
